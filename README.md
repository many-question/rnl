# Rich Netlist (RNL)

RNL is a proposed way to attach circuit meaning and presentation information to native netlists. This independent repository is intended to grow into a portable RNL runtime, solver, viewer, editor, and standard symbol library.

**Status:** This repository contains a directory skeleton and the RNL documents migrated from Analog Canvas. It has no parser, solver, renderer, application, build configuration, or released package. The language documents are drafts, not a published or frozen standard.

## Repository map

| Path | Intended responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`spec/`](spec/README.md) | RNL principles and syntax drafts; the only maintained location for language work. |
| [`crates/`](crates/README.md) | Future Rust runtime, host adapters, shared renderer, solver, and CLI. |
| [`bindings/`](bindings/README.md) | Separate runtime and solver WASM entry points. |
| [`packages/`](packages/README.md) | TypeScript SDKs and framework independent viewer/editor cores. |
| [`apps/`](apps/README.md) | Web application and desktop shell. |
| [`libraries/`](libraries/README.md) | External data libraries, starting with standard symbols. |
| [`tests/`](tests/README.md) | Future conformance, roundtrip, and integration corpora. |
| [`examples/`](examples/README.md) | Future example documents. |
| [`scripts/`](scripts/README.md) | Future project maintenance scripts. |
| [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/README.md) | Future CI workflow location. |
| [`docs/`](docs/README.md) | Toolchain architecture proposal, roadmap, and decision records. |

Start with the [documentation map](docs/README.md), the [toolchain architecture proposal](docs/rnl-toolchain-architecture.md) (in Chinese), and the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). Each component directory contains a short README describing its planned role.

## Next step

Define the first precise-profile language draft and establish real Cargo and pnpm workspaces as implementation begins. The [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) tracks this work without presenting it as complete.
